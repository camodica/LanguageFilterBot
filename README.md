# LanguageFilterBot

A bot I made because I wanted to make language a little cleaner on my discord server's text chat, and because I have a sense of humor. It replaces any match from a list of "banned" words with a nonsense word. Clean chats and comedy gold in the making!

Can toggle between "Agressive" and "Naive" modes, which detect a word in all possible places (like in other words) vs only exact matches of banned words.
